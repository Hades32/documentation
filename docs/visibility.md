This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Temporal Visibility.

The term Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Cluster.

## Standard Visibility

Standard Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, is the subsystem and APIs that list Workflow Executions by a predefined set of filters.

Open Workflow Executions can be filtered by a time constraint and either a Workflow Type, Workflow Id, or Run Id.

Closed Workflow Executions can be filtered by a time constraint and either a Workflow Type, Workflow Id, Run Id, or Execution Status (Completed, Failed, Timed Out, Terminated, Canceled, or Continued-As-New).

## Advanced Visibility

Advanced Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, is the subsystem and APIs that enable the listing, filtering, and sorting of Workflow Executions through a custom SQL-like <a class="tdlp" href="#list-filter">List Filter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><div class="tdlpc"><p class="tdlppt">How to use List Filters in Advanced Visibility APIs</p><p class="tdlppd">A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an Advanced Visibility List API.</p><p class="tdlplm"><a class="tdlplma" href="#list-filter">Learn more</a></p></div></a>.

## List Filter

A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an <a class="tdlp" href="#advanced-visibility">Advanced Visibility<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><div class="tdlpc"><p class="tdlppt">How to use Advanced Visibility application features</p><p class="tdlppd">Advanced Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, is the subsystem and APIs that enable the listing, filtering, and sorting of Workflow Executions through a custom SQL-like List Filter.</p><p class="tdlplm"><a class="tdlplma" href="#advanced-visibility">Learn more</a></p></div></a> List API.

A List Filter contains <a class="tdlp" href="#search-attributes">Search Attribute<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><div class="tdlpc"><p class="tdlppt">How to use Search Attributes</p><p class="tdlppd">Search Attributes enable complex List Filters to find the exact of Workflow Executions you are looking for.</p><p class="tdlplm"><a class="tdlplma" href="#search-attributes">Learn more</a></p></div></a> names, Search Attribute values, and Operators.

- The following operators are supported in List Filters:

  - **AND, OR, ()**
  - **=, !=, >, >=, <, <=**
  - **IN**
  - **BETWEEN ... AND**
  - **ORDER BY**
  - **LIKE**

- Wildcards ('\*', '%', etc.) are supported for string-type List Filter Search Attributes.

  - Use wildcards with the **LIKE** operator to query possible values:

  ```bash
  // Create a "ProductId" custom Search Attribute of type String
  tctl admin cluster add-search-attributes --name ProductId --type String

  // Match values that start with "book"
  ProductId LIKE "book%"

  // Match values that contain "favorite"
  ProductId LIKE "%favorite%"
  ```

- A List Filter applies to a single Namespace.

- The range of a List Filter timestamp (`StartTime`, `CloseTime`, `ExecutionTime`) cannot exceed `9223372036854775807` (that is, `maxInt64: 1001`).

- A List Filter that uses a time range has a resolution of 1 ms on Elasticsearch 6 and 1 ns on Elasticsearch 7.

- List Filter Search Attribute names are case-sensitive.

- An Advanced List Filter API may take longer than expected if it is retrieving more than 10 million Workflow Executions.

- A `ListWorkflow` API supports pagination.
  Use the page token in the following call to retrieve the next page; continue until the page token is `null` or `nil`.

- To efficiently count the number of Workflow Executions, use the `CountWorkflow` API.

## Search Attributes

The typical method of retrieving a Workflow Execution is by its Workflow Id.

However, sometimes you'll want to retrieve one or more Workflow Executions based on another property. For example, imagine you want to get all Workflow Executions of a certain type that have failed within a time range, so that you can start new ones with the same arguments.

You can do this with <a class="tdlp" href="#search-attributes">Search Attributes<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><div class="tdlpc"><p class="tdlppt">How to use Search Attributes</p><p class="tdlppd">Search Attributes enable complex List Filters to find the exact of Workflow Executions you are looking for.</p><p class="tdlplm"><a class="tdlplma" href="#search-attributes">Learn more</a></p></div></a>.

- [**Default** Search Attributes](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute/#default-search-attributes) like `WorkflowType`, `StartTime` and `ExecutionStatus` are automatically added to Workflow Executions.
- _Custom Search Attributes_ can contain their own domain-specific data (like `customerId` or `numItems`).
  - A few [generic Custom Search Attributes](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute/#custom-search-attributes) like `CustomKeywordField` and `CustomIntField` are created by default in Temporal's [Docker Compose](/clusters/quick-install/#docker-compose).

The steps to using custom Search Attributes are:

- Create a new Search Attribute in your Cluster using `tctl search-attribute create` or the Cloud UI.
- Set the value of the Search Attribute for a Workflow Execution:
  - On the Client by including it as an option when starting the Execution.
  - In the Workflow by calling `UpsertSearchAttributes`.
- Read the value of the Search Attribute:
  - On the Client by calling `DescribeWorkflow`.
  - In the Workflow by looking at `WorkflowInfo`.
- Query Workflow Executions by the Search Attribute using a <a class="tdlp" href="#list-filter">List Filter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><div class="tdlpc"><p class="tdlppt">How to use List Filters in Advanced Visibility APIs</p><p class="tdlppd">A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an Advanced Visibility List API.</p><p class="tdlplm"><a class="tdlplma" href="#list-filter">Learn more</a></p></div></a>:
  - <a class="tdlp" href="/tctl-v1/workflow#list">In `tctl`<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><div class="tdlpc"><p class="tdlppt">tctl workflow list</p><p class="tdlppd">How to list open or closed Workflow Executions using tctl.</p><p class="tdlplm"><a class="tdlplma" href="/tctl-v1/workflow#list">Learn more</a></p></div></a>.
  - In code by calling `ListWorkflowExecutions`.

Here is how to query Workflow Executions:
